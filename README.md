# Competitive Programming Course Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the competitive programming course I am currently undertaking. This repository is dedicated to storing and sharing Python solutions to various competitive programming problems.

## About the Course

This course challenges students with a series of programming problems covering algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking. It aims to prepare participants for programming competitions and interviews.

Here is the official description of the course:

CS392 C1 â€“ Algorithms for Competitive Programming

**Previously posted as CS392 B1**

Prerequisites: CS112 and CS131. Strong performance in CS 112 and CS 131 is expected. An assessment test might be administered in the first week to provide feedback on readiness to take this class.

This course covers essential algorithms necessary to compete in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and similar contests. Active involvement in weekly contests is a mandatory component of the course. Topics covered include standard library classes and data structures, competitive programming contest strategies, string manipulation, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, number theory, computational geometry, and combinatorics.

Professor: Tiago Januario
